# backend/seed-user.py

# This script can be used to seed the database with an initial user.
# To implement, you would:
# 1. Make this a runnable script.
# 2. Import the necessary services (e.g., user_service) and the database session.
# 3. Create a user with a default email and password.

print("Seed user script placeholder created. Implement as needed.")
