### PROMPT

Implement Enhanced Home Page for Phase 2 based on specs/ui/home-page-enhanced/spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and provided code snippets. Generate/update frontend/src/app/page.tsx with full cyberpunk neon theme:
- Animated blob background (pink/cyan/purple with blur/mix-blend).
- Hero: Big neon gradient title "Neon Todo", subtitle, conditional CTA buttons (glow hover/scale).
- Features grid cards with lucide icons/hover glow.
- App mockup preview section (desktop + mobile placeholders with neon borders).
- How It Works steps with icons.
- Testimonials cards with quotes.
- FAQ accordion (useState toggle, chevron rotate).
- Final big CTA button.
- Footer with links/social/copyright.
Preserve all existing styles (keyframes blob, neon-text, shadow-neon, variables like --bg-primary).
Use lucide-react icons, Tailwind responsive classes.
No manual changes - generate clean, professional code matching snippets.
Save in frontend/src/app/page.tsx.

### RESPONSE

I have successfully implemented the new "Enhanced Home Page" by updating `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` with the new design and components, including the Hero, Features, Mockups, Testimonials, and FAQ sections.
