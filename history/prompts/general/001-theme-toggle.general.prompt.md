```

## Response Text
Implemented a complete dark/light theme toggle functionality for the application with enhanced visual design and deployment configuration:

1. Created ThemeContext with state management for theme (light/dark)
2. Developed ThemeToggle component with animated sun/moon icons
3. Integrated theme toggle into the Navbar for both desktop and mobile views
4. Updated the root layout to use ThemeProvider
5. Ensured all UI components use CSS variables for consistent theming
6. Added localStorage persistence for theme preference
7. Added system preference detection (respects user's OS-level theme setting)
8. Fixed client component directives to resolve Next.js server/client component issues
9. Created ThemeProviderWrapper to properly handle client component in server component context
10. Improved light theme color consistency and professionalism with better contrast and neon integration
11. Enhanced Navbar logo visibility in light mode with improved neon text styling
12. Fixed homepage card styling for better light mode appearance with proper CSS variable usage
13. Corrected CSS class typo in homepage for proper text color rendering
14. Updated API URL configuration to connect to deployed backend on Hugging Face Spaces
15. Fixed CORS configuration to allow frontend requests from different origins
16. Analyzed API route structure to ensure frontend-backend compatibility

The theme toggle is now available in the navigation bar on both desktop and mobile views, allowing users to seamlessly switch between dark and light modes. The theme preference is saved and persists across page reloads and browser sessions. The light theme has been significantly enhanced with better color contrast, improved logo visibility, and consistent neon styling for a more professional appearance. The application is now configured to connect to your deployed backend at https://touseef-todo-app.hf.space/api with proper CORS settings to allow cross-origin requests.

## Outcome
Successfully implemented a responsive theme toggle that enhances the user experience by providing both dark and light mode options. The implementation follows modern UX practices with smooth transitions and persistent user preferences.

## Evaluation
- Theme toggle works correctly in both desktop and mobile views
- Theme preference persists across page reloads
- Smooth transitions between themes
