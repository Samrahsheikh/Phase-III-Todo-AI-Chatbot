# Implementation Plan: Todo Console App - Phase 1

**Branch**: `002-todo-p1` | **Date**: 2026-01-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-todo-p1/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a command-line todo application for Phase 1 of Hackathon II. The application will manage tasks in memory, providing five basic operations: adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. The development will follow a spec-driven approach using Python, with no external dependencies.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: None (Python standard library only)
**Storage**: In-memory Python dictionary or list
**Testing**: pytest (if applicable)
**Target Platform**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: Respond to user input within 500ms for all operations on a list of up to 100 tasks.
**Constraints**: Ephemeral storage (in-memory only), no external dependencies.
**Scale/Scope**: Foundational phase with 5 core features for a single user session.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **P1: Spec-Driven First**: Compliant. This plan is derived from a detailed specification.
- **P2: Agentic Workflow**: Compliant. All code will be generated by the agent.
- **P3: Simplicity**: Compliant. The project uses in-memory storage and has no external dependencies.
- **P4: Reusable Intelligence**: Compliant. The project structure allows for modular and reusable services.
- **P5: Clean Code Principles**: Compliant. The project structure and guidelines enforce clean code.
- **P6: Proper Python Project Structure**: Compliant. The plan follows the specified project structure.
