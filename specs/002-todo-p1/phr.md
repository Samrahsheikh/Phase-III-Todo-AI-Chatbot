# Phase 1 Review: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

**Date**: 2026-01-01

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 1 for the Todo In-Memory Python Console App. The primary objective of this phase was to build a functional, in-memory, command-line todo application with basic features, strictly following a spec-driven development process.

## Achievements

-   **Implemented 5 Core Features**: Successfully implemented all five basic-level features as per the specification:
    1.  Add a new task with a title and description.
    2.  View the list of all tasks with status indicators.
    3.  Update the details of an existing task.
    4.  Delete a task by its ID.
    5.  Mark a task as complete or incomplete.
-   **Spec-Driven Development**: Adhered to the spec-driven workflow, with a complete history of specifications, plans, and tasks tracked in the `specs/` folder.
-   **Agent-Only Workflow**: All code was generated by the AI agent (Claude Code), with no manual code writing.

## Challenges

-   **Spec Refinement**: The primary challenge was refining the specifications with enough detail and clarity to ensure the AI agent could generate correct and functional code. This required several iterations of planning and task breakdown.

## Next Steps

-   **Prepare for Phase II**: The next phase will focus on evolving the application into a full-stack web application with a persistent database, user authentication, and a web-based user interface.

## Compliance Check

-   **Constitution Adherence**: The project followed all principles outlined in the project constitution.
-   **No Manual Code**: All code was generated through the agentic workflow.
-   **Documentation**: A `CLAUDE.md` file with instructions for the AI agent was included as part of the deliverables.

## Demo Instructions

1.  Set up the environment using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  The console will display a menu of options.
4.  When viewing tasks, the status will be indicated as `[ ]` for incomplete and `[X]` for complete.
