# Research for Phase 2 Todo Full-Stack Web App

## 1. Decision: Technology Stack Confirmation

**Rationale**: The chosen technology stack aligns with the project constitution (C1) and was confirmed during the planning phase.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Other frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)
- Other backend frameworks (e.g., Django, Node.js)
- Other database systems (e.g., MongoDB, SQLite)

These alternatives were not chosen as the current stack (Next.js 16+, FastAPI, Neon DB, Better Auth JWT plugin, Tailwind CSS) meets all project requirements and constraints as defined in the constitution and specification.
