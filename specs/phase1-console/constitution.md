# Constitution for Hackathon II: Evolution of Todo (Phase 1)

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Ratification Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Last Amended Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Project Name**: Hackathon II: Evolution of Todo (In-Memory Python Console App)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the governing principles, constraints, and development methodology for Phase 1 of the "Evolution of Todo" project for Hackathon II. The goal is to build an in-memory, console-based Python Todo application.

Development will strictly adhere to a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) process, utilizing Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. All development activities, from specification to implementation, will be performed by the agentic workflow, with no manual code writing.

## 2. Guiding Principles

### P1: Spec-Driven First
All work must follow the `Specify -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implement` cycle. Features and changes must be first defined in a specification, architecturally planned, broken down into verifiable tasks, and then implemented.

### P2: Agentic Workflow
All code, documentation, and project artifacts must be generated by the AI agent. Manual coding is strictly prohibited. The developer's role is to provide clear specifications and refine them until the agent produces the correct output.

### P3: Simplicity
The application must be simple and self-contained.
- **Storage**: All data will be stored in-memory using standard Python dictionaries and/or lists. No file-based or database persistence is allowed in this phase.
- **Dependencies**: The project must not have any external dependencies beyond the Python 3.13+ standard library.

### P4: Reusable Intelligence
Where applicable, the agent should leverage subagents or reusable components to perform complex tasks, promoting modularity and efficiency in the agent's own workflow.

### P5: PEP 8 Compliance
All generated Python code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide to ensure readability and consistency.

### P6: Modular Code with Docstrings
The application code should be organized into logical modules and functions. All modules, classes, and functions must have clear, descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

### P7: User-Friendly Error Handling
The application must handle potential user errors and exceptional cases gracefully, providing clear and helpful messages to the user.

## 3. Constraints

- **Python Version**: Must be Python 3.13 or newer.
- **Data Storage**: Tasks will be stored in an in-memory dictionary or list of dictionaries. Each task must have a unique, auto-incrementing ID.
- **User Interface**: The application will be a console application that runs in a continuous loop, presenting a menu of options to the user until they explicitly choose to exit.

## 4. Governance

### Constitution Check Process
Before any implementation task is executed, the agent must verify that the proposed changes align with the principles and constraints defined in this constitution. Any deviation must be flagged and requires an explicit amendment to this document.

### Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this constitution require a formal process where the proposed change is specified, its impact is analyzed, and the constitution is updated with an incremented version number.

- **MAJOR** version change for backward-incompatible changes.
- **MINOR** version change for new principles or significant additions.
- **PATCH** version change for clarifications and typo fixes.
